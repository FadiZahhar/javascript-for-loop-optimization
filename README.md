# [JavaScript For Loop Optimization][published url]
## Instructor: [Tom McFarlin][instructor url]

In this video, we'll look at some steps we can take to optimize our loops so they are as performant as possible. We're going to be doing this through the use of a demo web application, three different browsers with tests and sample code.

We'll try to answer the following questions.

1. What is the fastest way to iterate through a collection of elements?
2. Why is this important to know?
3. Does the type of data you're iterating through matter?
